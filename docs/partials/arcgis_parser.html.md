<h4> Primitives </h4>

The Terraformer Primitives are classes that map directly to their GeoJSON equivalents, adding convenience methods, geometric tools such as `within`, and `intersects` and spatial reference conversion methods.

<h4> Tools </h4>

Terraformer also exposes many generic tools for working with geographic data.
